<li>Do not join voice chat channels without permission of the people already in there
If you see that they have a free spot it is alright to join and ask whether they have an open spot, but leave if your presence is not wanted by whoever was there first.

The Admins and Mods will Mute/Kick/Ban per discretion. If you feel mistreated dm an Admin and we will resolve the issue.

All Channels will have pinned messages explaining what they are there for and how everything works. If you don't understand something, feel free to ask!

Your presence in this server implies accepting these rules, including all further changes. These changes might be done at any time without notice, it is your responsibility to check for them.</li>
